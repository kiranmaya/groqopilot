![GroqoPilot](https://res.cloudinary.com/kidocode/image/upload/v1714062326/output_s7a9gh.gif)

Groqopilot is a Visual Studio Code extension that integrates Llama3, and Groq, a high-speed inference engine, into your coding environment. Driven by the desire to use Groq everywhere, I built this for myself, hoping it can help others too.

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: Like Copilot, but with only some essential features.
- **Code Generation**: Interacts with the active editor. Select code, ask a question, and the selection becomes the context for your query. Responses can be inserted or replace the selected text or cursor location.
- **Session Management**: Stores each chat session, letting you review your history and access them.
- **Auto-Completion [Coming Soon]**: Provides suggestions for code completions based on the active editor's context.

## Future Plans

- Customizable prompts and templates for streamlined coding workflows.
- Lets users set specific versions of libraries they want to use. I really need this feature myself, and fast!
- Better context-awareness and code generation based on the active editor and the user's coding style.
